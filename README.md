# Rust-Exercism-97-Problems
A collection of my solutions to the 97 Problems on Rust Programming available on https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises


NOTE-TO-SELF: You learned lifetimes in the High Scores problem.


Possibly going to have to abandon this project now after being completely and utterly demotivated after not scoring an A in Rust due to technical issues; how is this my fault...


-----------------------------

The date today is January 11, 2025. And today I have decided to take up Rust... again. I have 30 out of 98 problems done on Exercism. But I do not remember Rust at all. Like, at all. I can't even remember if there are semicolons in Rust...

Anyways, here it goes... I think...

This will now be a roadmap, a manual, a step-by-step, very explicit, very spoon-fed instruction guide that I will put together for MY own self to help me remember, once again, if I forget Rust again. I just want to be smart. I really, really, really just want to be smart. Why isn't this easy...

Okay, enough emotional-ness. Time for work. I will need to clean up this message later. Forgot I missed writing so much. Lol.

So there are three resources actually:
- Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Rustlings Course: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/ (It's a GitHub repository. Eww.)
- Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/

Okay wait wow there's more stuff. I need to look through these.

Oh you also need to install Rust by the way. The link is this apparently: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Okay, so I like Rust by Example and I _think_ this is what I used initially when learning Rust too because it looks like my type but I'm not sure. I also _think_ I understand the Rustlings GitHub repository (at least so far when reading its README.md file) so this is _maybe_ false optimism or actually good - who knows. The Rust Book is wordy woohooo. This is going to be good too.

So. Many. Choices.

Let me look at the other resources too. Okay closing the Exercism website for now.
