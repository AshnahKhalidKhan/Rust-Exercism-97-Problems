# Rust-Exercism-97-Problems
A collection of my solutions to the 97 Problems on Rust Programming available on https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises


NOTE-TO-SELF: You learned lifetimes in the High Scores problem.


Possibly going to have to abandon this project now after being completely and utterly demotivated after not scoring an A in Rust due to technical issues; how is this my fault...


-----------------------------

The date today is January 11, 2025. And today I have decided to take up Rust... again. I have 30 out of 98 problems done on Exercism. But I do not remember Rust at all. Like, at all. I can't even remember if there are semicolons in Rust...

Anyways, here it goes... I think...

This will now be a roadmap, a manual, a step-by-step, very explicit, very spoon-fed instruction guide that I will put together for MY own self to help me remember, once again, if I forget Rust again. I just want to be smart. I really, really, really just want to be smart. Why isn't this easy...

Okay, enough emotional-ness. Time for work. I will need to clean up this message later. Forgot I missed writing so much. Lol.

So there are three resources actually:
- Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Rustlings Course: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/ (It's a GitHub repository. Eww.)
- Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/

Okay wait wow there's more stuff. I need to look through these.

Oh you also need to install Rust by the way. The link is this apparently: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Okay, so I like Rust by Example and I _think_ this is what I used initially when learning Rust too because it looks like my type but I'm not sure. I also _think_ I understand the Rustlings GitHub repository (at least so far when reading its README.md file) so this is _maybe_ false optimism or actually good - who knows. The Rust Book is wordy woohooo. This is going to be good too.

So. Many. Choices.

Let me look at the other resources too. Okay closing the Exercism website for now.

Okay so this the Rust Standard Library: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html. I do not understand one bit of this. Not. One. Bit.

The next resource is this Editions Guide (https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/index.html) and this looks useless. It just looks like a history of Rust thing which is okay fine, only cool if Danial tells it in his fun way. Miss that guy, yeah.

Ooo okay so this is the Cargo Book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) and this looks like pro-programmer stuff so I am immediately closing this right now.

Rustdoc Book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/command-line-arguments.html) also looks like too pro-programmer stuff. Would be cool if I ever made a cargo/crate in Rust one day. A legacy. Whoa. Anyways...

This is something called the Rustc Book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/what-is-rustc.html) and it looks pretty useless too.

Okay whoa, this looks PRETTY useful. This is the Rust Compiler Error Index which tells us detailed explanations of compiler errors: https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/error-index.html. This is epic.

This is the Rust Command Line Book: https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html. It's supposed to tell us how to build command line applications in Rust and I _think_ this is what Danial used for piping the inputs/outputs in the Krypton code so let's see cause this is important.

Also, side-note: I should probably go through the BuildYourOwnX projects for Rust too and create a plan too. (I am soooo over-complicating this again, aren't I...)

I am not so sure about this resource, to be honest. It's the Rust WebAssembly Book (https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/). I _think_ this is like something to do with doing web-development with Rust or something...? I'm going to keep it.

This is the Embedded Rust Book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/embedded-book/) and honestly speaking, it looks like witchcraft. I'm not going near this thing. It's voodoo at work for sure.

Ooo what's this! This is the Rust Reference (https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/index.html) and it looks _vaguely_ familiar. It has a lot of headings... Guess we're keeping this too... (Dreading it already...)

The Rustnomicon and the Rust Unstable Book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html and https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/index.html) are self-professed trouble so we will stay AWAY from these without a second thought. You're welcome.

Guess that concludes our resources. I am going to make a video for this someday I think. Would I be a fun YouTuber? Nah, not likely. Anyways. Bye, GitHub. I should nickname you too. Another day, maybe.
